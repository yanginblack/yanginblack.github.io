# 2026 Week 0 (01/01 - 01/05)

## Week Overview

Weekly Focus: Research & Validation
Idea Candidates:
	•	WhatIf
An AI-powered simulation tool that allows users to explore alternative life paths and reflect on “what if” decisions to mitigate regret.
	•	RealPhoto
An AI-assisted image analysis tool that evaluates whether an image is AI-generated or a real photograph, aimed at supporting trust and fraud prevention.
	•	FocusCat
A gamified focus timer designed to reduce phone distractions and encourage deep work through reward-based mechanics.
	•	CodeCleaner
A governance and maintenance tool for “vibe coding,” focused on automatically organizing, documenting, testing, and monitoring AI-generated codebases.
	•	BusinessDIY
An automated compliance assistant for small LLC owners, tracking license renewals, state filings, and regulatory changes via SMS/email notifications.


## Work Completed
I conducted a deep-dive analysis of each idea, comparing them across three primary dimensions:
	1.	Market Impact – clarity and urgency of the pain point
	2.	Effort Estimation – development complexity and time to MVP
	3.	Competitive Landscape – existing solutions and differentiation

Key Findings
	•	RealPhoto emerged as the most viable candidate for a near-term MVP with realistic profitability potential. It addresses a clear and immediate pain point for small businesses and e-commerce sellers, and can be implemented and launched within an estimated 2–3 weeks.
	•	FocusCat is heavily dependent on strong UI/UX design and visual polish, which would require skill sets or resources currently missing.
	•	CodeCleaner involves significant engineering effort and would likely require a team and external investment to deliver meaningful value.
	•	BusinessDIY is conceptually promising but would involve substantial operational overhead, including ongoing data collection and regulatory maintenance.
	•	WhatIf is well-suited for hackathons or experimental projects but is resource-intensive, dependent on strong LLM foundations, and may introduce legal and ethical considerations.

Based on this analysis, I decided to move forward with RealPhoto as the primary focus.

## Key Takeaway
The most important priority at this stage is to focus on a single project, complete an MVP, and test it in the market as quickly as possible rather than continuing parallel ideation.

## Next Week's Goals
Technical validation of RealPhoto
	•	Prototype core image analysis pipeline
	•	Validate feasibility of initial detection signals
	•	Define scope for a minimum sellable MVP
