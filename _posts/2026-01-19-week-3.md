# 2026 Week 3 (01/19 - 01/25)

## Week Overview
MVP is ready for launch! 
This week I focused on upgrading the analysis report by improving the accuracy of core detection methods and redesigning each section for clarity and interpretability. The goal was to produce a higher-quality, user-facing report that is ready for public use and capable of collecting meaningful feedback from early users.

## Work Completed
- Researched Google Vertex AI and Google Cloud Vision APIs and evaluated their suitability; determined they are not a good fit for this use case  
- Improved CFA analysis using more detailed and robust detection logic  
- Updated Sightengine API integration and refined how results are displayed in the report  
- Enhanced EXIF information extraction and presentation  
- Revised DQT table logic by matching compression patterns against known fingerprints stored in the database  
- Improved noise analysis calculation and interpretation  
- Refined chromatic aberration analysis for better consistency with camera optics  
- Redesigned verdict logic, confidence scoring, and visual indicators for clearer final assessment  
- Added support for PDF report generation  
- Deployed locally and completed end-to-end testing of the full workflow  
- Set up user authentication, including Google Social Login and free-credit usage logic  

## Key Takeaway
- The current pipeline relies heavily on Sightengine as the primary signal; developing an in-house model would allow deeper analysis, including generator-level attribution, and provide stronger differentiation  
- User discovery and direct feedback are now the most critical next steps  

## Next Week's Goals
- Launch the product publicly  
- Reach out to a small number of direct users to gather initial feedback and validate real-world use cases
