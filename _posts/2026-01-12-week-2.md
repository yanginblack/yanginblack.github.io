# 2026 Week 2 (01/12 - 01/18)

## Week Overview
This week I focused on implementing the end-to-end workflow of TruePhoto.

At this point, the full flow is functional: users can log in, upload images, view analysis reports, and access previously generated reports from their history. The current user experience is intentionally minimal but sufficient for an MVP.

Infrastructure costs are still low: at the moment, only Railway incurs a ~$5 charge, while all other services remain within free tiers.


## Work Completed
	•	Implemented the web application using Next.js
    •   Deploy Frontend code on Vercel
    •   Implemented the backend image analysis service using FastAPI
    •   Deployed analysis service on Railway (usage-based, ~$5 tier)
    •   Set up user authentication, database, and storage using Supabase
    •   Integrated all components end-to-end, enabling:
	    •	User login
	    •	Image upload
	    •	Image analysis and report generation
	    •	Viewing historical uploads and corresponding reports

## Key Takeaway
	•	The image analysis pipeline requires relatively high memory usage (approximately 2–3 GB RAM for image with 1M+ size). Free tiers on platforms like Render—and even lower paid tiers—are insufficient. Railway’s flexible tier, with expandable memory up to 8 GB, is currently the most viable option despite usage-based pricing.
	•	The current report accuracy is inconsistent across test cases. Several analysis methods produce noisy or irrelevant signals, indicating the need for deeper evaluation and refinement of the detection pipeline.
	•	No direct user or client validation has been done yet. The next critical step is to speak with people who genuinely need this type of report and understand how they interpret and value the results.


## Next Week's Goals
	•	Improve report quality, clarity, and signal reliability
	•	Start showing the product and reports to potential users and gather direct feedback
