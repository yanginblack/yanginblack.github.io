# 2026 Week 1 (01/05 - 01/11)

## Week Overview

This week was focused on validating the technical feasibility of RealPhoto and clarifying what is realistic for an MVP versus what belongs to longer-term research.

The key realization is that perfect AI image detection is still an open research problem, but a commercially viable MVP does not require perfect accuracy. Instead, combining multiple weak-to-strong signals into a clear, explainable risk assessment is both achievable and valuable for real-world use cases.


## Work Completed
	•	Evaluated existing commercial AI image detection APIs and compared their reliability and usability for MVP integration.
	•	Experimented with several traditional and heuristic image analysis methods (metadata inspection, frequency-based analysis, noise patterns) to assess their practical usefulness.
	•	Reviewed recent academic research and open datasets to understand what level of accuracy is achievable under real-world constraints.
	•	Investigated watermark and signature detection approaches and assessed their current feasibility for short-term implementation.
	•	Tested multiple public and commercial detection tools to benchmark accuracy, transparency, and reporting quality.

## Key Takeaway
	•	No single method can reliably determine whether an image is AI-generated, especially after platform compression or post-processing.
	•	Commercial APIs currently outperform DIY approaches and are suitable for MVP use.
	•	The real product value is not binary judgment, but risk scoring + evidence-based reporting that can support disputes and decision-making.
	•	Watermark detection is promising but immature; it should not block MVP launch.
	•	An MVP can be built by orchestrating existing tools, adding lightweight analysis, and focusing on clarity and credibility of the output.
